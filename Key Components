Key Components---

1.Load Balancer: Routes traffic, performs health checks, ensures high availability.

2.API Gateway: Manages routing, rate-limiting, authentication, and throttling under surge loads.

3.Auth Service: Handles authentication/authorization using JWT or OAuth2.

4.Application Layer: Stateless service layer that accepts optimization tasks and delegates to background workers or real-time processors.

5.Job Queue: Buffers high volumes of requests, enables asynchronous processing, retries on failure, and decouples compute load.

6.Optimization Engine: The core logic (e.g., berth scheduling) encapsulated in containerized microservicesâ€”can autoscale independently.

7.Datastore: Relational DB with partitioning (e.g., by port, time) for faster queries; includes replication for fault tolerance.

8.Cache (Redis): Speeds up common queries (e.g., port status, berth availability), offloads read pressure from DB.

9. Monitoring & Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager track metrics, logs, and system health.

10. Cold Storage: Archive historical jobs and logs for audits and offline analysis.
